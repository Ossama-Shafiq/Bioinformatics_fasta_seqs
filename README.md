It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
These scripts have been carried out in a linux enviroment with both **ncbi-blast+** and **MUSCLE** bioinformatics based tools installed.

**MUSCLE** must be installed for sequence alignment tools: **conda install -c bioconda muscle**

To install **blast** for the command line (working directory recommended to be within home): **sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+**
